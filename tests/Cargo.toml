[dependencies]
# If your Committee and SignatureShare structs (or their underlying logic)
# depend on external crates (e.g., for cryptography), add them here.
# For example:
# ed25519-dalek = "2"
# rand = "0.8"

# For now, if your test.rs is self-contained with mock definitions,
# you might not need any external dependencies yet.
